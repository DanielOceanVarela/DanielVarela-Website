        <br>
        I have been involved in leadership positions since before my freshman year of highschool and have gained vast amounts of experience since then. My greatest achievements stemmed from the managerial positions I took up during my senior year of high school when I helped manage two clubs simultaneously. As an officer of our schoolâ€™s Gay-Straight Alliance(GSA), I was in charge of planning, advertising, and supervising on-and-off-campus events-many of which had high student turnouts. During my second semester, I was appointed as Treasurer for my track team and directed multiple successful fundraisers and ensured all obligations were turned in on time, all while continuing to hold my Officer position in GSA and maintaining a 4.5 GPA. 

During this time, I was also a fully committed member of PUENTE- a student organization which aids latin-american students in shaping their futures and focusing on academics. Aside from participating in club events or taking courses on Chicano studies and career readiness, a requirement of PUENTE was to complete a minimum of 100 hours of community service each year- which I did throughout all 4 years of high school. 

Currently, I am a full time student at UCR majoring in Psychology with intentions of pursuing a career in social work or attending graduate school and potentially becoming a professor myself. Outside of class, I work approximately 15 hours a week as an event planner and coordinator for campus events at the Highlander Union Building. And beyond academics and work, I have found myself involved in the Highlander Gloves Boxing Club. Despite my extremely limited schedule, I have managed to balance the many time commitments of my life and continue to receive great marks on the work I submit.
